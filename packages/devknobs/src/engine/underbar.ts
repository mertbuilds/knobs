 * of the screen. The band there shows a picture of the document past the
 * viewport's bottom edge: one picture of the whole document, drawn by the
 * browser through an svg, which a scroll only moves. It is pictured again
 * when the page changes, at most as often as keeps its cost to a tenth of
 * the time. What is pinned to the screen is left out of it, as it stays in
 * the viewport on the phone, and a fixed footer's color is carried down
 * instead, by the screen's fill under the band. A page out of reach shows
