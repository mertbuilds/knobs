# Chrome Web Store listing

## Store listing

**Name**

```
devknobs
```

**Summary** (the manifest's `description`, at most 132 characters)

```
The devknobs panel on any page, with text size, offline, media preferences, viewport and user agent set for real by Chrome.
```

**Description**

```
devknobs puts a small panel on any page you open, so you can see how the page behaves under other settings without changing its code: text size, light and dark, contrast, reduced motion and transparency, offline, the viewport and phone sizes, the user agent, the locale, the time zone, the clock and more. It is the same panel as the devknobs npm package.

Some knobs are set for real by Chrome instead of being imitated inside the page:

- Text size changes the browser's default font size, so rem and em units and em media queries follow with no rewrite of the page.
- Offline really cuts the tab's network.
- Color scheme, contrast, reduced motion and reduced transparency reach every media query of the tab.
- A plain width or a phone with nothing drawn around it becomes the tab's own viewport, with touch, and nothing reloads.
- The user agent and its client hints go out on every request of the tab, so servers see the browser you picked.

Real or in-page: the real knobs use Chrome's debugger, so Chrome shows its "started debugging this browser" bar while one is set. A switch in the panel's settings turns that off, and then every knob except the user agent is imitated in the page, as the npm package does it, with no bar. The user agent is always set by a request rule, which shows no bar.

The panel also has the views a front end developer reaches for: grab (click an element to copy its html, the components that rendered it and where they live in the code, for a coding agent), inspect, a requests view laid out like the browser's network panel, storage, replay animations, and a phone or foldable drawn around the page.

What servers see: nothing changes until you set a knob. The user agent knob changes the User-Agent and client hint headers of that tab, and of what that page's service worker fetches from its own host. While the panel's width frame is open, frames of the page's own host in that tab load without X-Frame-Options and Content-Security-Policy, so the page can show inside the frame.

Privacy: the extension sends nothing to the developer or any third party, and has no analytics. The panel's only requests go to the page you are on: its bundles and source maps for grab, its fonts, and a second load of the page in the frame. The device images ship in the extension. The extension keeps its settings in Chrome's storage on your computer, and the panel keeps its settings under devknobs keys in that page's own storage. Privacy policy: https://knobs.dev/docs/privacy

The screenshots are the extension's own build in Playwright's Chromium on https://knobs.dev:
the panel with text size, reduced transparency and reduced motion set; an iPhone 18 Pro with
Safari's bar; a demo request's Headers tab in the requests view; the settings with the "real
browser settings" switch.

## Privacy practices

**Single purpose**

```
devknobs puts a developer panel on the page you are building, so you can see how it behaves under other browser settings (text size, color scheme, contrast, motion, offline, viewport, user agent and more), with some of those settings applied for real by Chrome to that tab.
```

**Permission justifications**

`debugger` (the store takes at most 1000 characters per justification)

```
Used only on the user's action, to apply a setting for real to the tab they are working on. It attaches in three cases: (1) "real browser settings" is on and the user sets text size, offline, a media preference or a viewport; it detaches when all are back to default. (2) The user presses "find out why" after a page refused to load in the panel's frame; it watches that frame's next load. (3) The user presses "load without the service worker"; it detaches when the frame closes. Commands: Page.getFrameTree, Page.setFontSizes, Emulation.setEmulatedMedia, setDeviceMetricsOverride, clearDeviceMetricsOverride, setTouchEmulationEnabled, setEmitTouchEventsForMouse, setUserAgentOverride, Network.enable, emulateNetworkConditions, setBypassServiceWorker, Audits.enable, Log.enable. While attached it notes frame loads in memory; only Sec-Fetch values are shown in the panel, nothing is stored or sent. With real browser settings off it never attaches for a setting.
```

`declarativeNetRequestWithHostAccess`

```
Session rules for the tab the user is working on, added and removed by the user's settings. (1) The user agent setting: a rule sets the User-Agent and client hint request headers on that tab's requests, and on what that page's service worker fetches from its own host. It goes when the setting goes back to system or the tab closes. (2) The width frame: only while the panel's frame is open in a tab, a rule removes X-Frame-Options and Content-Security-Policy from frame loads of the page's own host in that tab (and from what that host's service worker fetches from itself), so the page can load inside the frame. It goes when the frame closes, the tab loads another page or the tab closes.
```

`offscreen`

```
One offscreen document reads the user's own color scheme and reduced motion preference with matchMedia, outside every tab. The panel uses it to keep the user's own look while a tab's media preferences are emulated, since the emulation hides the real values from every media query in that tab.
```

`storage`

```
chrome.storage.session keeps each tab's settings, which tabs have the panel's frame open on which host, and each tab's user agent setting with its page's host, so they survive the extension's service worker restarting. Chrome clears it when it closes. chrome.storage.local keeps one switch: real browser settings on or off. The panel on the page keeps its own settings under devknobs keys in that page's sessionStorage and localStorage. Nothing is sent to the developer or any third party.
```

`webNavigation`

```
Listens to onBeforeNavigate for a tab's top frame only, to remove that tab's frame rules (and stop skipping service workers) when the tab loads another page, since the frame they were for is gone with the old page.
```

Host permission `<all_urls>`

```
The panel is a developer tool for whatever page the user is building, on any host, including localhost, so its content scripts run on every page at document_start, before the page's own scripts, as the npm package would. declarativeNetRequestWithHostAccess needs host access to modify the headers described above on the page's host.
```

**Remote code**

```
No, I am not using remote code.
```

Every script is bundled in the package (`background.js`, `bridge.js`, `content.js`, `offscreen.js`): no `eval`, no `new Function`, no remote `<script>` or `import()`. The device images ship in `bezels/`.

**Data usage**

What user data do you plan to collect: tick none. Nothing goes to the developer or any third
party, and there are no analytics. The panel's only requests go to the page the user is on: its
bundles and source maps for grab, its fonts, and a second load of the page in the frame. The
device images ship in the package. The extension keeps what is listed under `storage` above, and
the panel keeps its settings under `devknobs` keys in that page's own storage, on the user's
computer only. While the debugger is attached, in any of its three cases, it notes the tab's
frame loads in memory, including the full headers of up to 50 recent requests with cookies and
authorization; only their `Sec-Fetch-*` values go into the record shown in the panel, and none of
it is stored or sent. See the privacy policy: https://knobs.dev/docs/privacy

Tick all three certifications:

- I do not sell or transfer user data to third parties, outside of the approved use cases.
- I do not use or transfer user data for purposes that are unrelated to my item's single purpose.
- I do not use or transfer user data to determine creditworthiness or for lending purposes.
