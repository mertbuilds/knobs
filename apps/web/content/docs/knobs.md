these put the page in a frame, a real viewport, so media queries and `vw` follow. see [devices](/docs/devices).

| mock, browser, bars    | the phone's body and its browser               |
| edge to edge           | the page runs under Safari's bars on an iPhone |
| touch pointer          | the mouse acts as a finger                     |
| device pixel ratio     | 1, 2 or 3                                      |
| frame, zoom, mat       | the frame alone, its zoom, the mat's color     |

## the clock and your server

turn on "send to server" and `fetch` and `XMLHttpRequest` calls to the page's own origin carry the clock's time. the first page load does not. read it on your server:

```ts
const now = (request: Request) => {
  const header =
    process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' ? request.headers.get('x-devknobs-now') : null;
  return header ? new Date(header) : new Date();
};
```

never honor the header in production. any client can send it.
