# knobs

The `devknobs` npm package and its site, <https://knobs.dev>, in one pnpm + turbo monorepo.

The site is a copy of [mertbuilds/web-starter](https://github.com/mertbuilds/web-starter) stripped to the
layers a landing page needs: no database, no auth, no billing, and only a stateless demo api. Keep it that way:
nothing gets added until the site needs it.

## Architecture

```
apps/
  web/    TanStack Start (React 19, React Compiler) → Cloudflare Workers.
          Client-first: SSR, routes, Paraglide i18n. No auth, no database.
          Two server routes: `/api/op/$`, the OpenPanel analytics proxy, and
          `/api/demo/$`, what the demo request buttons ask for.
packages/
  devknobs/ The `devknobs` npm package: the panel itself. Vanilla TS, zero runtime
          dependencies, built and tested with bun. Its own README and CHANGELOG.
  extension/ The devknobs Chrome extension (private, not published): the panel on any
          page, some knobs set for real through `chrome.debugger`.
  ui/     StyleX tokens + Base UI wrappers + Storybook. The devknobs panel's tokens.
  env/    Zod-validated client env schema. All env access goes through here.
  config/ Shared tsconfig base.
```

Web app (`apps/web`): `pnpm --filter @knobs/web dev` (:3000 standalone, or portless-assigned `PORT` under `pnpm dev`), `build` (Workers bundle), `deploy` (build + `wrangler deploy`), `cf-typegen` (binding types).

## Local URLs (portless)

`pnpm dev` serves both apps behind [portless](https://portless.sh): stable named HTTPS URLs instead of ports:

| Service   | URL                               | Without portless |
| --------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| web       | https://knobs.localhost           | :3000            |
| storybook | https://storybook.knobs.localhost | :6006            |

- First run needs one-time setup in a terminal: `sudo pnpm exec portless proxy start --https` (binds 443, generates + trusts a local CA). After that the proxy auto-starts. `pnpm exec portless service install` makes it start on boot.
- portless injects `PORT` (4000-4999 pool) into each app; vite reads it in `vite.config.ts`, storybook takes it as `--port`. If TLS is in the way, `--no-tls` on portless or curl `-k`.

## UI (`packages/ui`)

- Components come from the [shadcn-cssinjs](https://www.shadcn-cssinjs.com) registry (StyleX on Base UI, copy-paste-own) into `src/ui/`, then adapted to this repo. The shadcn CLI currently fails on this registry's cross-registry deps; fetch item JSON from `https://www.shadcn-cssinjs.com/r/<name>.json` and write the files (see the `shadcn-cssinjs` skill for the exact adaptation checklist: relative imports, named stylex imports, `| undefined` on optional props for exactOptionalPropertyTypes).
- Two token layers, both ours: `src/lib/tokens.stylex.ts` (component tokens: shadcn CSS variables from `src/theme.css`, dark via `prefers-color-scheme`) and `src/tokens.stylex.ts` (app-level: `colors`, `shadow`, `radius`, `spacing`, `font`, raw `palette`). Components use the lib tokens; app layout uses the app tokens. Never raw color values.
- The site wears the devknobs panel's tokens, so page and panel look like one thing. Source of truth: the panel's stylesheet (`packages/devknobs/src/ui/styles.ts`). Its warm neutrals (ground, ink, hairline, card, track, raised, faint as `muted`, a step darker in light for 4.5:1 on a card) follow the visitor's scheme as the panel does; grab's blue is `colors.accent`. Radii are the panel's concentric scale: 13 panel, 8 rows and fields, 4 controls, 6 grab's label bar. Font is the panel's system stack (`font.family`), with `font.mono` for code and readouts; the site ships no font files of its own. The one font file the page loads is the demo's one-glyph `knobs specimen` font (`/api/demo/asset.woff2`, from `src/app.css`), for the inspect specimen only. Components inherit the font from the app body; they set none themselves.
- Icons: `lucide-react` (named `*Icon` imports, so it tree-shakes) at 16px, stroke 1.5, `currentColor`, `aria-hidden`, 8px from their label, only where they help scanning (group titles, buttons, outbound links). Brand marks (GitHub, npm, and the agent card's Chrome, Firefox, Google, Apple, Android) are inline Simple Icons paths (CC0) in `apps/web/src/lib/brand-marks.tsx`, not a package.
- Logo: the master is `apps/web/src/assets/logo.svg` (200 viewBox; its colors are its own, the same on both grounds). `public/favicon.svg` is a copy of it and `KnobsMark` in `brand-marks.tsx` is the same drawing inline, 20px beside the hero's wordmark; change all three together. The PNGs in `apps/web/public` come from the master through headless Chrome, then `sips` (Chrome will not open a window as small as an icon): `"/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome" --headless=new --hide-scrollbars --default-background-color=00000000 --window-size=512,512 --screenshot=logo-512.png file://$PWD/apps/web/src/assets/logo.svg`, then `sips -z 32 32 logo-512.png --out apps/web/public/favicon-32.png` (and `-z 16 16` for `favicon-16.png`). `apple-touch-icon.png` is the same at `--window-size=720,720` from a copy with the panel's corners square (`sed 's/ rx="44"//'`), then `sips -z 180 180`: iOS rounds the corners itself. The logo study and the other candidates are in the owner's wiki, not in this repo.
- Current set: Button, Input, Field (label/error composition), Dialog, Select, Table, Label, Separator, Skeleton, Toaster (sonner, next-themes dropped). Grow on demand from the registry.
- A story is the test: every component has colocated `*.stories.tsx` with `play` interaction tests. `pnpm --filter @knobs/ui test` runs them in real Chromium via the Storybook Vitest addon (Vitest browser mode). `pnpm storybook` serves them on :6006.

## Web (`apps/web`)

- TanStack Start on Cloudflare Workers. Custom entry `src/server.ts` (wrangler `main`) wraps the Start handler with `canonicalRedirect`, `paraglideMiddleware` and an evlog wide event per request (Axiom drain when `AXIOM_TOKEN`+`AXIOM_DATASET` set); wrangler `observability` stays disabled so logs are not duplicated.
- React Compiler is on (`react({ compiler: true })` via `oxc-transform-react`).
- i18n: Paraglide v2, `messages/en.json` only. Generated `src/paraglide/` and `src/routeTree.gen.ts` are gitignored build output: never edit them, they regenerate on `vite dev`/`build`. All user-facing strings go through `m.*()`.
- Env: `apps/web/.env` (copy `apps/web/.env.example`). Vite reads it, and the Cloudflare vite plugin also hands it to the Worker as local dev vars. `VITE_*` vars are validated in `packages/env`, all of them optional, so the site runs with no env at all.
- StyleX in routes: import `../app.css` (build injection target); there is no importable `virtual:stylex.css` module; in dev the plugin middleware serves the CSS itself.
- No tests live here: `packages/ui` stories cover the components, the routes are the landing and the docs pages, and the two server routes hold no state. Add a vitest project back if that changes.

### devknobs in dev

- `apps/web` depends on `devknobs` as `workspace:*`. The dev server runs it from source, so the site is its test bed: `vite.config.ts` aliases `devknobs` to `packages/devknobs/src/index.ts` (only under `vite dev`), and edits there reload the page with no build.
- Types, `vite build`, CI and prod use the package's `dist`, which turbo builds first (`^build`). A fresh clone needs `pnpm --filter devknobs build` (or `pnpm build`) once before `tsc` or a lone `pnpm --filter @knobs/web build` sees its types and files.
- Device images come from `packages/devknobs/assets/bezels` (a dev middleware maps the source's `src/engine/bezels/` URLs there).
- The early script (`devknobs/early?raw`) goes first in `<head>` through `src/server.ts` (HTMLRewriter, in place of the `script[data-devknobs-early]` slot `__root.tsx` renders, so each head script hydrates onto its own). The slot needs both `dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: '' }}` and `suppressHydrationWarning`: without the first, React finds the server's script text in an element it expects empty, fails hydration and renders the whole document again on the client; the second silences the dev warning that the text differs. Builds inline the package's `dist/early.global.js`; under `vite dev` the plugin bundles its `src/early.ts` instead and rebuilds it when its sources change.

### Tuning the fold (dev)

- `https://knobs.localhost/?tune` adds a small card in the window's bottom left corner (`src/dev/foldtune.tsx`), with one slider per constant of devknobs' fold (the iPhone Duo: mostly how much the turning half of the screen is blurred). It draws them from the hook devknobs puts on the top page's window under `Symbol.for("devknobs.foldtune")`, which is there once a Duo has folded, so no key is written here. Each change is live. Under the head, one muted line says what drew the last fold (`drawn by webgl`, `drawn by layers`, `not drawn yet`) and why, from the hook's `info()`; a build without it shows no line, and "copy" and "save" carry it as `info`. "compare" shows the defaults while it is held. The card can be dragged by its head, and the values last a reload of the tab (`sessionStorage`, `knobs:foldtune`).
- "save" posts the values to `/__tune/fold`, a `vite dev` middleware (`vite.tune.ts`) that writes them to `apps/web/.tune/fold.json` (gitignored). "load last saved" reads that file back. The values are then baked into devknobs' fold constants by hand, from that file.
- The card shows more where the hook has it, each part only then. "presets": one button per named value set from the hook's `presets()` (such as `ours`, `jadon`, `jadon blur`); a press sets every key of it the spec has, and the one the values now equal shows as on. "angle 92.0": the hinge's angle from `angle()`, 0 shut to 180 open flat, with its own "copy". "page picture" downloads the PNG the fold draws on the turning screen (`shot()`) as `knobs-page-<width>x<height>.png`; with none, the hook's `shotWhy()` shows for a moment. That picture goes into the "Custom" mode of jadon's open demo of the same fold (<https://iphone-duo-tawny.vercel.app/>), its fold slider (0 to 180, 180 open) set to the same angle, to compare the two side by side. "copy" and "save" carry `preset`, `angle` and `ref` too.
- Reference pages show Apple's own screen images in our fold. `?tune&ref=<name>` (the card's "reference" row: one button per name, and "page" to go back) makes the index route draw `src/dev/reference.tsx` in place of the landing page: one image over the whole viewport on black, `<name>-inner.*` when the viewport is wider than it is tall or wider than 600px (the Duo open), `<name>-outer.*` otherwise (the cover screen). The frame loads the window's address, so its copy of the page draws the same. The panel mounts there; the tour does not. The images are in `apps/web/.tune/ref/` (gitignored, fetched by hand from Apple's public URLs, never committed, never shipped), named `[a-z0-9-]+` with `png`, `avif`, `jpg` or `webp`. `vite.tune.ts` lists them at `GET /__tune/ref` and serves each at `GET /__tune/ref/<file>`, from the page's own origin so the fold's picture of the page can hold them.
- Dev only: `__root.tsx` loads the card and `routes/index.tsx` the reference view behind `import.meta.env.DEV`, so a build has none of it and reads no `ref`, and the copy of the page in a device's frame never shows the card. Its words are plain literals, not Paraglide messages (`apps/web/src/dev/**` is exempt from `react/jsx-no-literals`).
- The rule: these tools are for local development only. Nothing of them goes into a build (the card, the reference view, the `/__tune/*` endpoints, which are `vite dev` only), and the images in `apps/web/.tune/` are never committed and never copied into `public/` or `src/`. A new import of `src/dev/*` is a dynamic `import()` behind `import.meta.env.DEV`. `scripts/dev-tools-check.ts` runs at the end of the web app's `build` and fails it when the output holds one of the tools' strings.

### Analytics

- Self-hosted OpenPanel at `analytics.vinena.studio`. Page views plus eight events: `trackOutgoingLinks` and `trackAttributes` stay off, and one delegated `click` listener on `document` (`usePanel` in `src/lib/panel.ts`, through `track` in `src/lib/analytics.ts`) sends `link_click` for the page's anchors and `knob_click` for the devknobs panel's buttons and search results, read off `composedPath()` because the panel's shadow root is open. The code boxes' copy buttons send `copy_click` from their own handler, and the GitHub links send `github_clicked` with `placement` (`header`, `footer`) from theirs. The guided tour (`src/tour/`), a frame around the real control to use next, sends `tour_step` with the stop id (`open`, `duo`, `scroll`, `unfold`, `iphone`, `mat`, `grab`) when a visitor does that stop in the real panel while the tour is on, `tour_done` once all seven are done (`grab` is always the last: a pick counts only once the other six are done), `tour_close` with the stop it was closed at, and `tour_explore` when the final bubble's "Explore other knobs" button is pressed (it ends the tour and opens the panel's list of every knob). The inline loader in `__root.tsx` skips automated browsers (`navigator.webdriver`) and the copy of the page devknobs loads in a device's frame (`window.top !== window`), so a device pick is not a second page view. The tour has one owner, the top page, which alone draws it: the copy in the frame reads it from, and reports its scroll and its grab picks to, the page above through `window.knobsTour`, so the events go out from the top page only. A closed or finished tour is remembered in `localStorage` (`knobs:tour`), except with `devknobs=fresh` in the address, where nothing is read or written. Every devknobs selector the tour depends on is in `src/tour/targets.ts`.
- The client id comes from `VITE_OPENPANEL_CLIENT_ID`. Unset means the script is never injected. The id is public; the secret half never leaves the analytics host. CI reads the repo variable `OPENPANEL_CLIENT_ID` for production builds, and leaves it unset on PR previews.
- The OpenPanel project allows `knobs.dev` only, so local events answer `401 Ingestion: Invalid cors or secret`; dev traffic cannot reach the numbers even with the id in `apps/web/.env`. A 401 from `https://knobs.localhost` means the proxy works, not that it is broken.
- `src/routes/api.op.$.ts` reverse-proxies the vendor so a blocker that knows its host does not drop the page views: `/api/op/op1.js` serves the script, everything else goes to `<host>/api/*`. It forwards `cf-connecting-ip` as `openpanel-client-ip` **and** `x-client-ip`; without those OpenPanel counts every visit as the same device. It drops the visitor's `cookie` header before forwarding. It answers crawler POSTs with a bare 200 instead of forwarding them.

### The landing

- `src/routes/index.tsx` is one screen: the header (wordmark, GitHub button, tagline, the install boxes, the `⇧K` hint), the guided tour, the "try it here" stage (`id="try"`), and the footer (with `/docs` and `/docs/extension` among its links).
- The panel mounts through `usePanel()` (`src/lib/panel.ts`), which every page that shows the panel calls: idle on a first visit, at once when knobs are stored, with the click analytics listener. The landing passes the tour to it (`openTour` and `watchKnobs` from `src/tour/progress.ts`): the tour opens before the panel mounts, so the copy of the page in a device's frame finds it on the page above, and watches the knobs once the panel is on the page.

### Docs

- `/docs` and `/docs/<slug>` are the user docs for devknobs and the extension, built from `apps/web/content/docs/*.md`. A page is one markdown file with `title`, `description` and `order` in its frontmatter, no H1 (the title is the H1), sections from `##`. Add a page by dropping in a file: `order` sets its place in the sidebar and in previous / next. Links between pages are `/docs/<slug>#<id>`; a heading's id is its text lowercased, spaces to hyphens, everything but `[a-z0-9-]` dropped.
- `src/docs/pages.ts` loads the files (`import.meta.glob`, `?raw`), reads the frontmatter by hand and renders each page once, as the module loads, with `marked` (GFM). Its renderer puts the StyleX prose classes on the html; code blocks are split out and drawn with `CodeBox` (`src/lib/code-box.tsx`, the landing's copy box, `copy_click`). The html is the repo's own markdown, so it goes in through `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. `src/docs/head.ts` holds the routes' loader and head and imports the pages behind `import()`, so the entry bundle (which carries every loader and head) does not carry the docs. An unknown slug throws `notFound()` (404).
- Code blocks are highlighted once, as `pages.ts` renders, by `src/docs/highlight.ts`: highlight.js core with only the fence languages the content uses (bash, javascript/jsx, typescript/tsx, xml/html), its `hljs-*` scopes mapped to StyleX classes for 4 roles (`colors.codeKeyword`, `codeName`, `codeNumber`, `codeString`) plus `muted` comments. A fence with no language or an unregistered one stays plain; a new language in the content means registering its grammar there. `CodeBox` takes the html through `html` and still copies the plain `code`.
- `src/docs/layout.tsx` is the frame (`routes/docs.tsx`, with `usePanel()`): the top bar, the sidebar (a `<details>` menu on a phone), the page, "on this page" on wide screens, previous / next. `/docs/knobs` ends with a link to the stage on the landing (`/#try`).

### The stage

- `src/demo/stage.tsx` is the "try it here" stage of cards. It lives on the landing, after the tour: one card per knob row and per view of the panel, in a two column grid (`Cards` and `Card` in `src/lib/card.tsx`). A card never sets a knob. It shows what the page reads (`matchMedia`, `Intl`, `Date`, `navigator`, the viewport, storage), so a knob moved in the real panel shows there. The only buttons are for what a page has to start itself: a request, a write to storage, a dialog or popover, a question to geolocation, a box pushed past the edge for the overflow knob.
- The cards import nothing from devknobs, so devknobs' source and its built package draw the same stage. A new knob in devknobs' catalog (`packages/devknobs/src/ui/catalog.ts`) gets a card or a row here.
- Readouts go through `src/lib/live.ts`: `live(read, watch)` with `useLive` (a `useSyncExternalStore` whose server value is null, so the server and the first client render draw the same empty rows), and `held` for answers that come later. They listen where the browser has an event (media query `change`, `online`, `languagechange`, `resize`, a `ResizeObserver` for text size and safe areas) and look again on a timer only where it has none: the clock, the user agent, and storage while its card is in view.
- Every font size on the site is in rem, so the text size knob moves it. So are the size, gap and radius of the header marks and the copy buttons. Other spacing and radii stay in px.
- The look cards draw a small scene that the knob changes through real CSS (an app in the page's colors, a sign-in form, a frosted bar over a picture, a red and green chart, an article with a fixed px tag that clips, an orbit and a filling bar), with their readout rows under it. The illustration colors live in one `ART` object in `src/demo/look.tsx`.
- The motion card holds the stage's one animation, which starts when its card scrolls into view: a moon in orbit and a bar that fills with a bounce, which less motion stills to a slow fade. It reads the animation's `playbackRate` every half second while in view, since the speed knob has no event.
- The location, locale and time cards draw a small scene above their rows. Location: a map with a pin that glides to each answer (a fly-out for a jump, a steady pan along a playing route, with its trail), the world muted under a chip for a refusal, a pulsing pin for a timeout. Its land is `src/demo/land.ts`, one SVG path of Natural Earth's 1:110m land (public domain), simplified and committed, about 21 KB: no tiles, no map service. Locale: a checkout written by `Intl`, laid out from the line's start so rtl turns it around. Time: a clock face read every frame while in view (each second under less motion), so a fast clock spins it, beside a store that opens 9 to 18 and a countdown to midnight.
- The storage card is a small shop that keeps each thing where real sites keep it, all under the `knobs-demo` prefix, as readable JSON: the cart in `localStorage` (`knobs-demo:cart`, `[{"id":"mug","qty":2}]`), what this tab viewed in `sessionStorage` (`knobs-demo:viewed`), the cookie banner's answer in the `knobs-demo-consent` cookie (`all` or `essential`), "saved for later" in the `knobs-demo` IndexedDB database (object store `saved`, version 2), and "available offline" as the `knobs-demo` cache holding `/api/demo/json` and `/api/demo/asset.png`. It reads them back every 1.5 seconds while in view, so an edit or a clear in devknobs' storage view (`⇧S`) empties the cart, brings the banner back or turns offline off. A read never creates the database or the cache.

### Demo requests

- `src/demo/requests.tsx` is the stage's requests card: a small social app, one post beside its comments (one under the other on a phone), whose every action is a real request, so the devknobs requests view (`⇧N`) has every kind to show. Feed bar: "live" reads `events` as a stream and counts new posts, refresh is `slow` with a cancel that aborts it, the palette loads the theme (an image, stylesheet, script and font). Post: like is POST 201 (optimistic) and unlike DELETE 204, edit PATCH, delete DELETE 204 then undo PUT, share follows `redirect`, the caption's `example.com` link preview is the cors block, translate is the network error with a retry toast. Comments: show is GET `json`, "see it" is a 404, load more is a 500 whose retry gets `json`, summarize reads `stream` word by word, the photo button is an XHR upload with progress, send is a form POST 201. The rarer kinds are plain rows under "more requests": text, html, binary, big body, secret headers, a burst of 20, no-cors, and XHR get, timeout and error. Nothing in the card sends analytics events (the delegated listener reports anchors and the panel only; its links are buttons), and nothing of it goes through `/api/op`. Four requests leave the site on purpose: translate and the XHR error ask `https://demo.invalid/`, which never resolves, and the link preview and no-cors ask `https://example.com/`. The photo's colors are its own (`ART`); the app's tints are mixed from the tokens (`SCENE`).
- `src/routes/api.demo.$.ts` serves them under `/api/demo/*`: `json`, `echo` (GET, POST 201, PUT, PATCH, DELETE 204), `status/:code` (a fixed set of error codes), `redirect` (302 to `json`), `slow?ms=`, `big?kb=`, `text`, `html`, `bin`, `stream`, `events`, `asset.css`, `asset.js`, `asset.png`, `asset.woff2`. Every path but `echo` is GET only (a HEAD goes to the GET handler, so it is answered too); another method gets a 405 with an `allow` header. It holds no state and makes no outbound request. Caps: `slow` 3000 ms, `big` 512 KB (one row repeated), `echo` reads 16 KB of the body, `stream` is 10 lines over 3 seconds, `events` is 4 events over 3 seconds. Every answer is `cache-control: no-store` and `x-robots-tag: noindex`. The echo names a fixed list of request headers and sends back a value only for `content-type`, `accept`, the demo's own fake token (`src/demo/fake.ts`) and `x-devknobs-now` when it is an ISO instant (the clock's "send to server" knob, which the time card asks about), and `content-length` as a plain number; any other value comes back as `sent`. The `html` answer has no `<head>`, so `server.ts` adds no early script to it.

### Deploy

- `pnpm --filter @knobs/web deploy` = `pnpm build`, which needs devknobs' `dist` (`pnpm --filter devknobs build` first), then `wrangler deploy`. The Cloudflare vite plugin writes the deploy-time config to `dist/server/wrangler.json` and points `.wrangler/deploy/config.json` at it, so wrangler ships the built config rather than `wrangler.jsonc` itself. Push to main does the same from CI (`deploy.yml`); the command is for a one-off.
- `wrangler.jsonc` carries `account_id` and two custom domains: `knobs.dev` (canonical) and `www.knobs.dev`. `canonicalRedirect` (`src/lib/canonical.ts`, called from `src/server.ts`) answers `www` with a 301 to the apex, path and query kept.

### i18n lint

- All user-facing strings go through Paraglide (`m.*()`). `react/jsx-no-literals` (oxlint, error) forbids hardcoded JSX text and text-bearing attributes (label/placeholder/title/alt/aria-\*); stories and scripts are exempt via overrides. `packages/ui` components take all text as props. Inline `oxlint-disable` only with a justification comment.

## devknobs (`packages/devknobs`)

- The `devknobs` npm package, moved here from mertbuilds/devknobs with its git history. Vanilla TS, zero runtime dependencies, React optional (`devknobs/react`). Its user docs are `apps/web/content/docs` on the site (knobs.dev/docs); its README is short and links there. Its release notes are `packages/devknobs/CHANGELOG.md`.
- It keeps bun as its build and test runner, so bun must be installed (CI pins the version in `oven-sh/setup-bun`). Its dev dependencies install through pnpm with the rest of the workspace; there is no `bun.lock`.
- `pnpm --filter devknobs build` writes `dist/` (`scripts/bezelurls.ts` regenerates `src/engine/bezelurls.ts` first; `scripts/tunefree.ts` fails a build that holds the fold tuning tools). `pnpm --filter devknobs test` runs `bun test`, `pnpm --filter devknobs typecheck` runs its own `tsc` (TypeScript 5, not the root's 7). turbo runs all three with the rest.
- Root oxlint and oxfmt, and the lefthook pre-commit jobs, skip `packages/devknobs`: it has its own style (double quotes, long lines) and its own checks. Do not reformat it to the root's rules.
- Release: in a PR, bump `version` in `packages/devknobs/package.json` and add the `CHANGELOG.md` entry (run `pnpm --filter devknobs build`, then `npm pack --dry-run` from `packages/devknobs` to check the file list). After the merge, `git tag devknobs@X.Y.Z && git push origin devknobs@X.Y.Z`. `.github/workflows/release.yml` checks the tag matches the version, runs devknobs' tests, typecheck and build, and publishes through npm trusted publishing (OIDC, no token, provenance added by npm). A version with `-` goes to the `next` dist-tag. A tag for a version already on npm is a no-op. One-time setup: `npm trust github devknobs --file release.yml --repo mertbuilds/knobs --allow-publish`.
- `bun run link <app-dir>` / `bun run unlink <app-dir>` (from `packages/devknobs`) copy a local build into another app's `node_modules` to try it there. The site does not need it: it uses the workspace package.

## Extension (`packages/extension`)

- `@knobs/extension`: a Manifest V3 Chrome extension that mounts devknobs on any page and sets some knobs for real (DevTools protocol, `declarativeNetRequest`). Private, not published. Its user docs are `/docs/extension` on the site (`apps/web/content/docs/extension.md`); its README is short and links there.
- `pnpm --filter devknobs build` first: it bundles devknobs' `dist/`. Then `pnpm --filter @knobs/extension build` writes `dist/`, which Chrome loads unpacked (`chrome://extensions`, Developer mode, Load unpacked). Work in progress builds elsewhere (`bun scripts/build.ts <dir>`, from `packages/extension`), so `dist/` stays what Chrome has loaded.
- The extension's copy of devknobs mounts as the page's host (`mount({ host: true })`): a copy the page mounts itself hands it its keys and grab and takes no panel. See the extension's README, "How it fits together".
- `pnpm --filter @knobs/extension test` (`bun test`), `typecheck`, and `smoke`: `node scripts/smoke.ts [dir]` loads a build into Playwright's Chromium and drives it on local pages only. CI runs the smoke in the `test` job.

## Dev workflow

- `pnpm dev` runs mprocs with two panes: web and storybook. Quit with `q`; panes restart individually with `r`.
- When everything is broken for no reason: `pnpm bad-day` (kills dev processes, removes every node_modules/cache/generated dir, prunes the pnpm store, reinstalls). Preview with `DRY_RUN=1 pnpm bad-day`.
- Claude Code hooks (`.claude/settings.json`): every Write/Edit is auto-formatted (oxfmt) and auto-fixed (oxlint) on save; a Stop hook runs `pnpm typecheck` and blocks the stop if types are broken.
- Agent skills for the stack live in `.claude/skills/` (committed, pinned by `skills-lock.json`). Maintenance: `npx skills update` refreshes them; `pnpm skills:check` warns when a dep's installed major drifts from what its skill was last verified against (`skills.versions.json`); after a major dep bump, update the skill, re-verify, bump `checkedMajor`. MCP servers are pinned by exact version in `.mcp.json`.
- Renovate bumps deps (minor/patch grouped weekly, majors gated behind the dependency dashboard).

## CI/CD

- **CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, PRs + main): `checks` job = turbo lint/typecheck/build + `format:check` + `skills:check` + react-doctor; `test` job = Chromium story tests + devknobs' and the extension's `bun test` + the extension's smoke. Both jobs set up bun for devknobs. Turbo remote cache activates when `TURBO_TOKEN`/`TURBO_TEAM` are configured.
- **Deploy** (`deploy.yml`, push to main): builds devknobs, then wrangler-action builds and deploys `apps/web` to Cloudflare Workers.
- **Release** (`release.yml`, push of a `devknobs@*` tag): checks the tag matches the version, then tests, typechecks, builds and publishes devknobs to npm through trusted publishing. See the release line under devknobs.
- **Previews** (`preview.yml`): every PR builds devknobs and the site, uploads a Workers preview version and comments the URL. Previews build without the analytics client id, so preview traffic stays out of the numbers.
- Required repo config lives in README's "Going to production" checklist. CI must be green before merge.

## Rules

- Never edit generated directories: `apps/web/src/paraglide/`, `apps/web/src/routeTree.gen.ts`.
- No new dependencies, components, or abstractions without a concrete current need.
- Secrets never enter git. Local uses `apps/web/.env` (from `.env.example`); prod uses wrangler secrets.
- Conventional commits, enforced by commitlint. PRs only against `main`; CI must be green.
- Stack decisions are recorded in `docs/adr/`. Change of direction = new ADR. ADR-0001 is the founding record of the full boilerplate; this repo keeps only the web half of it.
